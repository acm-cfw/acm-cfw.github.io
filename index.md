# Introduction 

These pages describe the installation of a custom firmware (CFW) for the Astro City Mini (ACM) and Egret-II Mini (E2M) consoles. Due to the platform similarities, we hope to eventually produce versions for the Astro City Mini-V (ACM-V).

As part of this effort we have focused on [batocera](https://batocera.org) compatibility to get a full-fledged firmware.
