The Astro City Mini is based on an Allwinner R16 SoC. The graphics are driven by a Mali 400 GPU, and the screen has a native resolution of 480x800 (rotated).

The internal screen is rotated, and while the stock firmware applications have been rotated internally, any new applications  require to be manually rotated.
